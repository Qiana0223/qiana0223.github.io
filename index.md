I am Qiping Wei, a Ph.D. student in the [SERC lab](https://sercatuta-lei.github.io/) at The University of Texas at Arlington advised by [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://ranger.uta.edu/~ylei/).

My current research focuses on applying **deep reinforcement learning** and **LLMs** to enhance symbolic execution of Solidity smart contracts.
