  - description: "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning framework for sequence decision problems. It is effective to train agents to play a variety of games. This project takes an advantage of RL to learn an optimal policy to generate sequences by training an agent to play the game simulated on the symbolic execution process of a smart contract."

Sequence explosion is one main problem impacting the application of symbolic execution. This project applies a graph structure to guide the symbolic execution process to consider a small set of sequences. "
